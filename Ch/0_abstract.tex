%                      Abstract
% ==================================================
The abstract should typically be a few sentences on what you did. Usually in the style: "In this work we propose/we investigate ...". Generally you quickly contrast (one sentence) what has been done before and what you offer. You ideally describe what data you used, if you show improvements or not, and any other important findings. End with some conclusive sentence (e.g. this bodes well for, we concluded that this is a good approach) should be some kicker. Basically the whole abstract sells your paper, it should be an elevator pitch of your research.
